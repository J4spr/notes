Dear *friend*

I have a sport that I think that you will like.
The sport is called Wife Carrying and I will first explain what it is and what the rules are and then I will explain the benefits and all that to you.

You start with you holding your partner in a position that is the most comfortable for the both of you (choose it wisely because you need to run with you carrying your significant other)
One of the most popular grips is where your spouse <u>is hanging</u> upside down with her feet on the husbands shoulders and she grips the waist of the male. 
A course <u>needs to get</u> completed carrying your SO[^1] where speed is the key.
The course is about 250m long and has various obstacles that you need to conquer. 
Another rule is that you need to weigh at least 49kg and otherwise weights get hanged on the female.
When the female <u>is dropped</u>, a time penalty gets added.


The benefits of this sport are that you get to know each other in a total different way. Teamwork is key and this will test if you trust each other. This sport wil bring you 2 together.  It is also an unforgettable challenge.

The downside is that you need to have a partner to do this ;)

Kind regards
Jasper Verbruggen
